The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!

Solution:
with cte as(
SELECT count(distinct j.company_id) as duplicate_companies FROM job_listings j join job_listings j1 ON
j.company_id = j1.company_id
where j.title = j1.title and 
j.description = j1.description
group by j.company_id
having count(j.company_id)>1)
select sum(duplicate_companies) duplicate_companies from cte;
