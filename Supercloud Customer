🧠 Problem: Microsoft Azure Supercloud Customers
Goal:
Identify customers who have purchased at least one product from every product category listed in the products table. These customers are known as Supercloud customers.

🧾 Tables:
📄 customer_contracts
Column	Type
customer_id	integer
product_id	integer
amount	integer

📄 products
Column	Type
product_id	integer
product_category	string
product_name	string

🧪 Sample Input:
customer_contracts
customer_id	product_id	amount
1	1	1000
1	3	2000
1	5	1500
2	2	3000
2	6	2000

products
product_id	product_category	product_name
1	Analytics	Azure Databricks
2	Analytics	Azure Stream Analytics
4	Containers	Azure Kubernetes Service
5	Containers	Azure Service Fabric
6	Compute	Virtual Machines
7	Compute	Azure Functions

✅ Expected Output:
customer_id
1



🧠 Explanation:
Join customer_contracts with products to get each product's category per customer.

Group by customer_id and count distinct categories they’ve purchased from.

In the HAVING clause, compare that count with the total number of unique categories in the products table.

Only include customers who’ve bought from every category.

🧪 Query Logic in Simple Terms:
"For each customer, count how many different categories they’ve bought from. If that number equals the total number of categories available, then they are a Supercloud customer."



🧑‍💻 SQL Solution:
sql:

SELECT customer_id  
FROM customer_contracts c join products p ON
c.product_id = p.product_id 
group by customer_id
having count(distinct p.product_category) = (select count(DISTINCT product_category) FROM
products);
